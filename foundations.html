        <p>The pioneer families who settled this community valued and celebrated the human spirit. One local historian stated, &ldquo;Their chief aim was not great wealth but civilization. So, while they built their homes they helped build school houses and churches, sometimes living in dwellings lacking conveniences so that they might provide the other necessities of civilization.&rdquo; They recognized education as the means to an end, thus preparing their sons and daughters alike for a world that was yet to be created.</p>
        <p>In the egalitarian spirit of the frontier, reform-minded founders of the community of Walnut Grove established institutions of higher education to advance the civic impulse of abolitionism, the incipient cause of woman’s rights, and the social gospel calling to minister to the less fortunate through missionary efforts. The timeless values of the founders still animate the institutions that they helped to fashion.</p>

         <h2>As the first school in Illinois (and the third in the nation) to educate women on an equal basis with men, the new institution embodied a revolutionary ethic.</h2>
        </div>

        <p>Walnut Grove Seminary (1848) and Walnut Grove Academy (1851) were the academic predecessors of Eureka College, which was chartered by the Illinois Assembly on February 6, 1855. As the first school in Illinois (and the third in the nation) to educate women on an equal basis with men, the new institution embodied a revolutionary ethic. The list of eminent visitors to the College—including Abraham Lincoln, Horace Mann, Susan B. Anthony, and Booker T. Washington—is a testimony to the power of such ideas and values to transform society.</p>

        <p>As a church-related liberal arts college affiliated with the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), Eureka College prepared students for lives of service and leadership within the larger community. Many of its earliest graduates found their respective calling in the fields of education and the ministry with more than one hundred graduates participating in the important work of the foreign missions. The school provided educational leaders as well with over forty alumni eventually serving as college or university presidents across the nation. In time, Eureka College produced leaders in national social endeavors like the movements for temperance and for woman suffrage. Political leaders would also emerge as Eureka College boasts among its alumni nine members of Congress, three governors, and the fortieth president of the United States, Ronald W. Reagan (Class of 1932).</p>

        <p>Eureka College has always demonstrated a mission-specific resiliency to cultivate excellence in the areas of learning, service, and leadership and it has done so for 160 years since its chartering. The staying power of the institution (only 267 of the nation’s more than 3,000 colleges and universities are older than Eureka College) is testimony to the shared appreciation of what the school represents and the value-added benefit of what it provides to the larger community. </p>
        <p>The truest meaning of Eureka College might best be described in words often used by Dean Samuel G. Harrod, a legendary figure in the life of the College, who often said “Eureka College: Many larger, few smaller, none better!” The pioneer settlers who envisioned this institution over a century-and-a-half ago decided to plant the new College near the life-giving spring that nurtured the community and provided the social gathering place of the rustic settlement. Their decision could not have been more apt. This small college has impacted the nation and the world; the spring of knowledge continues to nurture the many who gather here in this special place “’neath the elms.”</p>

       <p>Grammar matters. Sometimes a single word, whether used in its noun form or its verb form, can fashion meaning that is both profound and wildly disparate from its alternative. As a case in point, I would submit the word “founder” for your consideration. As a noun, “founder” has a strong and celebratory ring to it—“one who establishes or creates”—and the term implies a type of legacy that is to be lauded by generations that follow. The alternative verb form “founder” is a term that is weak and uncertain—“to be unsuccessful or experience failure”—certainly not the kind of experience that subsequent generations would consider praiseworthy. We need to get it right.</p>
       <p>As Eureka College approaches its Founders' Day anniversary on February 6 and passes the 160-year milestone, we all know the proper grammatical form of the term—or do we? Most of the small, private, church-related institutions of higher education that were established in the United States during the nineteenth century foundered (verb) and did not survive to see the dawn of the next century. One source states that the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) was responsible for founding (noun) as many as 250 institutions of higher education in the nineteenth century, but only seventeen of these schools still operate today. Sadly, most of them foundered (verb).</p>
       <p>What then characterizes the institutions that survived? Was this a Darwinian-based competition in which only the strongest or the fit institutions survived? The answer is more complicated, and it is based in large part upon those individuals who were the Founders (noun) of these institutions and the values that they espoused. If we use Eureka College as an example, our Founders’ commitment to religious egalitarianism, the antislavery ideal, and the early movement for women’s rights strongly suggests that these individuals were cut from a different cloth than most of their contemporaries. In many respects, they were wide-eyed radicals with fire in the belly who were unafraid to challenge the sacred shibboleths of their time. They created a college precisely because it mattered, and subsequent generations have sustained that dream because the Founders’ shared values persist even sixteen decades hence. </p>

      <p>The Dickinson, Major, Davidson, Radford, Deweese, and Myers families, along with others, crossed the tall-grass prairie as they trekked from Kentucky to Illinois in the early-1830s, and here they were joined by Ohioans like John Darst and his family as they settled early Walnut Grove and built a community in this place. They faced hardship together—they even endured cholera together—and they discovered common purpose together. The civility of their common interests and their unwavering certainty of the dignity of all persons regardless of race, gender, or creed provided the context for all that they did. Their lives were purposeful, and all that they would establish was in large measure an expression of their shared values. Long before a corporate focus group ever coined the phrase “mission statement” our Founders knew almost instinctively that Eureka College had to stand for something—this institution had to matter.</p>

<p>Yet as we praise our Founders (noun) for their vision and moral courage, we must recognize that their dream would have foundered (verb) had it not been for the goodwill and the support of subsequent generations that have taken up the cause and supported the institution through the years. Every time that we stand together in community and sing the Alma Mater we voice the words “speed it onward”—and that is our charge. We cannot founder (verb) in our sacred call to be the living legacy of the Founders (noun). </p>

     <p>The president of the Higher Education and Leadership Ministries of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) will be the keynote speaker at Eureka College&rsquo;s 160<sup>th</sup> anniversary Founders' Day convocation at 4 p.m. Feb. 6 in the Cerf Center. Admission is free and open to the public. </p>

<p>The Rev. Bernard "Chris" Dorsey's presentation titled "A Tradition of Progress" will explore how transforming society through faith and reason was at the heart of the movement that gave birth to the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ). The presentation will highlight ways in which justice and equality have been woven into the fabric of Eureka College since its inception and throughout its history.</p>

<p>Dorsey became president of HELM in August 2014. He formerly was an assistant professor of theology and preaching at Western Theological Seminary, a church pastor, the chaplain at Clark Atlanta University and vice president of development and marketing at Chicago Theological Seminary. </p>
<p>Dorsey received a bachelor's degree from the University of Texas at Austin and a master of divinity degree from Garrett-Evangelical Theological Seminary. He is a Ph.D. candidate at the Divinity School of the University of Chicago.</p>
<p>Eureka College was founded by members of the Christian Church and is among 14 colleges and universities affiliated with the church. The college was incorporated on Feb. 6, 1855, by an act of the Illinois Legislature. The founding date coincides with the birth date of the college's most famous alumnus, Ronald Reagan, who graduated in 1932. In recognition of both the founding date and Reagan's birth date, the college traditionally serves birthday cake at the reception following the convocation.  </p>
<p>For more information about the convocation, <a href="mailto:bfowlkes@eureka.edu">contact Chaplain Bruce Fowlkes</a> or call (309) 467-6429.</p>
