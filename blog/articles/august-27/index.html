  <p>On Aug. 30, 1819, William Davenport and Eliza Major were married in Christian County, Ken. The marriage joined two families&mdash;the Davenports and the Majors&mdash;who would later play a significant role in the settlement of Walnut Grove (later Eureka) in what eventually became Woodford County, Ill. The familiar names Davenport and Major adorn school buildings, college residence halls and street signs in this community, making them an ever-present force in this town. A walk through Eureka&rsquo;s Olio Cemetery reveals how significant these two families were in the formation of this community, as these early settlers and many of their progeny are buried there. Descendants of these families still live in Eureka and surrounding communities.</p>

<p>It was common in early America for pioneer migrations to include several families that were united by marriage or by family relationships. Also, individuals who were co-religionists, in this case the Christian Church movement, often migrated together, and, in the process, founded new congregations in the communities they established. Often, pioneer communities experienced a type of serial migration where residents from one community moved to a new location and then convinced friends and relatives from back home to make a similar trek. The large concentration of early pioneers from Christian County, Ken., to this region suggests this type of migration pattern occurred as Walnut Grove was settled by pioneer families.</p>

<p>Although some pioneer families did inhabit this region in the early 1820s, it was in the mid-1830s that the Davenport and Major families relocated to central Illinois. A significant corps of the founding families associated with the history of Eureka College came to this region during Andrew Jackson&rsquo;s second term as President of the United States.</p>

<p>Speaking of marriages, one took place on Aug. 20, 1890, when Elvira &ldquo;Ella&rdquo; Seass married her college beau, Oliver Wayne Stewart, both from the Class of 1890. The Stewarts wasted no time after leaving Eureka College to become involved in reform movements at the state and national levels.</p>

<p>Ella Seass Stewart would eventually serve several terms as a national officer in the National American Woman Suffrage Association. She was among the women who were instrumental in having Illinois adopt woman suffrage legislation before it became national policy. Oliver Wayne Stewart was among the national leaders in the temperance movement and campaigned nationwide for the adoption of Prohibition. From 1899 to 1919 Stewart was the chairman of the National Prohibition Committee. When the nation was considering adoption of the Eighteenth Amendment providing for Prohibition, Stewart organized &ldquo;The Flying Squadron&rdquo; – a group of temperance advocates who traveled around the country speaking in support of the Prohibition measure from 1915 to 1920.
The college recently erected banners honoring 20 alumni for their outstanding achievements. Ella Seass Stewart’s image graces one of those banners.</p>
