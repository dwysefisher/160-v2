  <p>On April 19, 1888, the Board of Trustees of Eureka College accepted the gift offered by Wallace J. Ford – that of his family residence – for use as a college dormitory. The acceptance of Ford&rsquo;s offer came almost one year to the date after the death of Lida Ford, (who died of a fever on April 21, 1887), the 13-year-old daughter of Wallace J. and Mary Ford. The original home had been constructed about 1869 by a local attorney named Cassell, and accordingly, the large home was locally known as &ldquo;The Castle.&rdquo; The Ford family purchased the home after moving to Eureka sometime around 1882. The home was located on a corner of Burgess and James streets.</p>

<p>When the Ford family made the offer of their home to Eureka College, their primary stipulations were that the home be used as a residence hall for young women, that a wing be added to the original structure, and that the residence hall be named in honor of their deceased daughter. The structure was eventually named Lida&rsquo;s Wood to honor both the memory of the dead child, but also the grove of trees in which she once had played. The original Lida&rsquo;s Wood was destroyed by a fire in 1894. A second Lida’s Wood was built soon after; it was razed in 2000.</p>

<p>On April 21, 1917, a fraternity called Pi Alpha Theta was organized at the national level. It soon took a different name - Tau Kappa Epsilon (TKE). One of the earliest chapters of this new fraternity was established at Eureka College. The Iota Chapter of Tau Kappa Epsilon - the ninth to be established - is one of the oldest TKE chapters in the United States.</p>

<p>On April 23, 1970, the swimming pool in the Reagan Physical Education Center opened. The building would not be officially dedicated until December 1970.</p>

<p>On April 24, 1999, Eureka College President George Hearne announced that the new residence hall that was then under construction would be named for Ira and Genevieve Langston. Ira was president of the college from 1954 to 1977, and Genevieve taught there.</p>
