  <p>It all began on Sept. 10, 1848. That’s when Walnut Grove Seminary, the forerunner of Eureka College, opened its doors as an educational institution. Classes were offered to young men and young women in a one-room schoolhouse located near the first Christian Church built in the community of Walnut Grove (located where Olio Township Cemetery is now situated). Asa Starbuck Fisher was the first professor to teach at the institution.</p>

<p class="caption">The Seminary</p>


<p>The rough-hewn school building was a single-room structure that measured 16 by 16 feet. The building had been constructed a few years earlier by Jonathan Tressler, a local carpenter, and the structure was moved from the present southwestern corner of the cemetery lands to the northern site. In 1849, an additional room that measured 16 by 24 feet was added to the original structure. Three of the founders of the Walnut Grove Seminary – Ben Major, David Deweese and Elias Myers – each pledged $150 to finance the relocation of the structure and the improvements and additions that were made.</p>

<p>A stone now marks the spot where the Walnut Grove Seminary stood. This marker was dedicated by the Woodford County Historical Society on June 14, 1926. The inscription on the stone reads:</p>

<blockquote>HERE BEGAN

THE FIRST SCHOOL

IN EUREKA

1848<br />

THE BEGINNING

OF EUREKA COLLEGE</blockquote>


<p>By the mid-1850s the seminary building was no longer being used because the Academy Building had become the center of activity, and the structure was sold to a local family by the name of King. The King family would take in female boarders who attended Walnut Grove Academy. Several decades later, only two elderly daughters of the King family remained in the home, and the old seminary building was nicknamed the &ldquo;Queen&rsquo;s Palace&rdquo; by local residents.</p>

<p>It was from these humble origins that Eureka College came into being. It was through the foresight of these founders that an institution of higher education was born.</p>

<hr>


<p>On Sept. 11, 1954, more than 100 volunteers arrived on the Eureka College campus to spend an entire Saturday painting Lida&rsquo;s Wood Residence Hall. This task was especially important then as the college prepared for the huge centennial celebration that would take place during the spring semester of the 1954-55 school year. Many of the commemorative events associated with the centennial, like dinners, teas, etc., were to be held in Lida&rsquo;s Wood.</p>

<p>This massive work day came only a few months after Ira Langston had assumed the presidency of Eureka College. One of the stipulations that Langston had raised before accepting the position was that he wanted to make sure that Eureka College had the support of the many Christian Churches in Illinois. The volunteers who turned out on Sept.11 included representatives of 26 Illinois congregations.</p>
