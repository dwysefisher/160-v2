        <p>David Deweese was born on March 7, 1801, in Knox County, Ky. One of the founders of Eureka College, Deweese is honored by having a residence hall in the Founders’ Court complex named in his memory. He served as a trustee of the college in its first year, 1855. Deweese was considered to be among the old-timers in the community of Walnut Grove/Eureka. His family had moved to the region in 1830, which was about five years prior to the large migration of Christian County, Ky., residents, so Deweese was already well-established in the settlement when the new emigrants arrived.</p>...

        <p>John T. Jones was born Feb. 10, 1795. One of the early settlers to move to Walnut Grove, which later became Eureka, Jones established the first school in the community. Jones’ school for girls predated the establishment of the Walnut Grove Seminary in 1848. The school that Jones established was only open for one semester in the fall of 1847. Fifteen girls were enrolled there, and Emily Jones, the wife of John, and her daughter Susan served as the teachers.
